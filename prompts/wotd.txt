Build an API for a word of the day application. It should do the following:

Generate a word of the day for a given date. The word should be randomly selected, and should be different each day.

Give 2 examples of how to use the word in a sentence. Use OpenAI gpt-4-1106-preview to do this. An API key for OpenAI should be provided in a .env file. The examples should be generated entirely by gpt-4-1106-preview, but must be legitimate and contemporary uses of the word.
Remember when using gpt-4-1106-preview that it is a chat model, and so to get completions you need to use the chat endpoint rather than the completions endpoint. The chat completions endpoint is at https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Your OpenAI request body should adhere to the following schema:
{{
    "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    "messages": [{{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}}],
    "temperature": 0.1
}}
and the response you receive from the OpenAI API will have the following schema (more fields may be present, but you can ignore them):
{{
    'choices': [
        {{
          'message': {{
              'role': 'assistant',
            'content': 'She hummed a familiar tune while she worked, finding comfort in the melody that reminded her of her childhood. Realizing his guitar sounded off, he took a moment to tune the strings before continuing with the performance.'
            }},
      }}
    ],
}}

Define the word of the day. Use the API at https://api.dictionaryapi.dev to define the word. The dictionary API does not require a key. Definitions of the word should be dictionary definitions. If a word isn't in the dictionary, choose another word.
Users should be able to request the word of the day for any date past, present or future. Time zones are not important.
Use the Python FastAPI library.
For all external API requests, remember to be explicit about setting timeouts. Use 60 seconds as the timeout value for all requests.
Give clear instruction on how to spin up the server, prefer uvicorn with reload option so that the code will automatically reload after changing
